# Kandid Policy Document

Kandid is made by g33ks for g33ks who love what they do, and we always want it to be a community that upholds their interests first. So in what may be a world first, we're Open Sourcing our company policy under an Apache License 2.0. This is all about handing the product that is Kandid back to the people who matter most, and keeping their interests paramount.
