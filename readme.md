# Kandid Policy Document

Kandid is made by g33ks for g33ks who love what they do, and we always want it to be a community that upholds their interests first. So in what may be a world first, we're Open Sourcing our Company Policy Document under an Apache License 2.0. This is all about handing influence over the product that is Kandid back to the people who matter most, and keeping their interests paramount.

It's all about the golden rule of the internet: don't be a dick.

We invite any developers, designers and geeks in general with a profile on www.kandid.nz to fork this project and make commits to the markdown files in the usual way [see this git tutorial for further info](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html).

If you're completely new to git (or just a designer like me) - read [this excellent guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and jump in and get your hands dirty. Markdown is used for the policy files and there's more about how to use that [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). A simple text editor (like notepad) is all you need to edit .md files, however I recommend using something like [Atom](https://atom.io/).

Thanks so much,
@ezy and @juddey
